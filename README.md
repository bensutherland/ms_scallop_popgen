# Scallop Population Genomics
This repository is in development stage, and comes with no guarantees. 

### Requirements
- Digest: BiocManager, ShortRead, SimRAD, seqinr



## 1. Project planning
Before starting, plan the appropriate RADseq enzymes for use with the scallop, considering target number of loci and relation to sequencing depth.     
Use the following script, after updating the locations for the scallop and Pacific oyster genome (as a reference) reference genomes:       
`01_scripts/scallop_genome_digest.R`
